  <h1>Winter League</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Tuesday: Beat Truskin's team in Core. I really need to get better at being patient and also at boxing people out.</p>

<p>Wednesday: Lost to RABS in Full. They were on their second game and we were on our first, but we still lost by 4. I got 3 handblocks, but turned it over too much. Also, need to sub more rapidly.</p>
