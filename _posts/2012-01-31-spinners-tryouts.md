title: "Spinners Tryouts"
---

Went to the Spinners tryout on Saturday. It was kinda like Southpaw practice, but not as ridiculous. Didn&#39;t start too well, but finished second in survivor deep cuts and fourth (with Glazer) in survivor Roman chair. During the scrimmage, I got a bunch of Ds but also threw it away a lot. Pretty much my MO.
