title: "WL Finals and Spinners Tryout"
---

Played two games in winter league finals. First game was against Keg/Kuhfuss. We were up the whole game but I got hurt in the 3rd quarter (evertion ankle sprain) and we only won by one point. Next we played Laarz. I sat out the first half but started to play in the second half. We were down 5 late in the game, but then we threw the Trey zone and evened up the score. We couldn&#39;t pull ahead and ended up losing by 1. 

After that, I went to Spinners tryouts. We did the beep test, breakmark drill, hunger drill and 40 meter survivor sprints. We also scrimmaged a lot. In the end, I made the team. Expect a lot of &quot;spinners practice&quot; posts.
