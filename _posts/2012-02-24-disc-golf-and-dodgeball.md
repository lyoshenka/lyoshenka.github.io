Disc Golf and Dodgeball
=======================

Wednesday: Disc golf at Sedgely. I played really well on the front 18. I was -2 for a long time and finished -1. I've never even hit par before. The back back 9 went worse than usual, but we played the reds so that's to be expected. I think I was +3 for the back back (compared to -5 from the yellows the time before, but that was probably a major fluke).

Yesterday: Dodgeball playoffs. We're in the 5 through 8 bracket. I don't know what seed we are, but we won 7-3 last night so we're playing the 5v6 game next Thursday.
